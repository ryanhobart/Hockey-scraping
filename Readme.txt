This project is the beginning of what I hope is an interesting journey into NHL advanced statistics.

While I am fairly well versed in the data and analyses out there currently, I have a desire to create my own for two reasons:

	1. Personalizing the GUI for the database
	2. The ability to manipulate the data myself to test my own theories

The project in its current state consists of two working components: the main function which successfully prints results, and the Scraping class which successfully collects data from a provided game sheet.

The final goal for this project is to have an easy-to-use database for both finding and manipulating data based on all seasons of NHL available in data sheets.
